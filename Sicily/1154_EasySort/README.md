#1154. Easy sort

##Constraints

Time Limit: 1 secs, Memory Limit: 32 MB

##Description

You know sorting is very important. And this easy problem is:
Given you an array with N non-negative integers which are smaller than 10,000,000, you have to sort this array. Sorting means that integer with smaller value presents first.
##Input

The first line of the input is a positive integer T. T is the number of the test cases followed.
The first line of each test case is a positive integer N (1<= N<= 1000) which represents the number of integers in the array. After that, N lines followed. The i-th line is the i-th integer in the array.
##Output

The output of each test case should consist of N lines. The i-th line is the i-th integer of the array after sorting. No redundant spaces are needed.
