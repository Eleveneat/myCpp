##Description

略
##Input

注意：输入包含多个测试数据。
The first line of the input contains two integers, C and N. C (1 ≤ C ≤
 1 000 000) is the number of columns and N (1 ≤ N ≤ 3 000 000) is the number of sort operations. The second line contains N integers, ki (1 ≤ ki ≤ C). It defines the sequence of sort operations Sort(k1); ...; Sort(kN).
##Output

The first line of the output contains one integer, M, the length of the shortest sequence of sort operations equivalent to the input sequence (Subtask A). The second line contains exactly M integers, representing a shortest sequence (Subtask B). You can omit the second line if you solve only Subtask A.
