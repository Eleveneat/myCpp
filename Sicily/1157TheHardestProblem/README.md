##Input

Input may contain several test cases, one per line. For each test case, the first integer indicates n (1<=n<=4), the number of problems. And then n signed 32-bit integers follow. A case with n=0 indicates the end of input, which should not be processed.
##Output

For each test case, you must output the difficulty value of the hardest problem in a single line.
